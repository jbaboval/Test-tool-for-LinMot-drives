import LinRS

connection = Line('/dev/ttyN').connect()
drive = Drive(connection, '01') # Drive ID from S2

drive.initialize() # Walks the state machine to "Ready To Operate"
drive.move_home()  # Moves to the home position - move somewhere else soon to prevent overheat

# Position units is mm
drive.moveToPos(100, velocity=<Units: 1E-6 m/s>, max_acceleration=<Units 1E-5 m/s^2>, max_deceleration=<Units 1E-5 m/2^2>)

print drive.getStateVar()
